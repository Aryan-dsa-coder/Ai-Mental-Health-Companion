# Ai-Mental-Health-Companion
This is an AI-powered mental health companion that combines a chat-style frontend, an LLM-based backend agent, and integrations with Twilio WhatsApp and Google Maps. It is designed to offer empathetic, tool-augmented support, including:

Conversational mental health guidance using a therapeutic LLM (MedGemma via Groq)
Detection of crisis scenarios with an emergency call tool (Twilio voice)
A location-aware tool that finds nearby therapists using Google Maps
A simple Streamlit chat UI for web, plus a Twilio WhatsApp webhook for chat over WhatsApp
The project is structured as a small, opinionated demo of how to build a tool-using AI agent for mental health support.

Important: This project is for educational/demo purposes only and is not a substitute for professional mental health care. Do not rely on it for emergency situations.
